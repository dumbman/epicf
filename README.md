Ef is a software for charged particles dynamics simulation.
It's primary areas of application are accelerator science and plasma physics. 

Ef focuses on nonrelativistic energies. 
Currently, particular emphasis is placed on low-energy beams, such that can be found in ion sources and electron guns.

Particles dynamics is traced under action of external electromagnetic fields. 
Particle self-interaction is taken into account with [particle-in-cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle-in-cell) method.

Attention is given to integration with CAD software to allow for simulation of complex real-life experimental setups.
An experimental plugin for [FreeCAD](http://www.freecadweb.org/) exists.

Ef is a free software -- it's source code is open and avaible for modification and redistribution. 
It is written mostly in C++. 
Basic MPI support allows to take advantage of parallel execution in multiprocessor environment.
